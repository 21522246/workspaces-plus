# Workspaces+

Organize tabs into workspaces in Firefox.

This extension is a fork of [Tab Workspaces](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-workspaces/) made by [@fonse](https://github.com/fonse) with extra features.

## Features (from Tab Workspaces)
 - Each tab belongs to a workspace. New tabs are automatically added to the current workspace.
 - Switch between workspaces from the toolbar icon to keep your tabs organized.
 - Tabs in other workspaces are safely hidden away.
 - Pinned tabs are visible from all workspaces.
 - If you have multiple windows open, each one has its own set of workspaces.
 - Send a specific tab to another workspace from the right-click menu.
 - Press Ctrl+E to open the list of workspaces, then press 1-9 to switch between using keyboard shortcuts.
 - Search through your tabs in the address bar. Type "ws [text]" to begin searching. Choose a result to switch to that tab.

## Extra Features
 - Clone workspace.
 - Current workspace indicator.
 - Dark theme + UI improvements.
